# cambridge-modpack
Repository for custom modes in [Cambridge](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge).

## How to use
Download the source code ZIP from [here](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge-modpack/archive/main.zip).

Once done, extract the `tetris` and `res` folder into your Cambridge installation. That's it!

If you're using a .love file or a .exe file, you'll need to drag the folder into one of [these](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem) locations instead.

**WARNING:** The .exe / .love files and the bleeding edge releases have different save directories. Read the above link carefully!

Also, we have a `skins` folder. Click it to read instructions.

Remember to check out this repository for new modes!
